# Frontend Engineer skills test

Welcome\!

We’re thrilled that you’ve chosen to challenge yourself with Stema. If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to reach out to Federico via LinkedIn or email at federicogiudici@stema.io.

Good luck\!

### **How Stema works**

Stema is a platform that connects two key stakeholders: jobseekers and employer clients. We position ourselves in the middle, serving both sides to maximize career opportunities for jobseekers and enable employers to find the right engineers efficiently.

**The task**  
In this exercise, you’ll be tasked with designing a user interface that helps a jobseeker easily understand which job they should apply to next. The goal is to ensure that the jobseeker immediately finds the information they are looking for about the job in a clear and intuitive way.  
It’s important to note that Stema is used by jobseekers on both mobile and web platforms.  
 

## **Skill Test: Frontend Match-Trial Project**

### **Overview**

Hello\!  
This trial project focuses on creating a **user-friendly frontend** for a job matching application. We have three JSON files:

* **job.json**: a list of jobs, each with associated skills and their respective “weights”.  
* **jobseeker.json**: a list of jobseekers, each with their skills.  
* **match.json**: a list of matches between jobs and jobseekers (see jobseeker\_id and job\_id)

Your task is to build a minimal **frontend application** (in whichever framework you prefer) that displays matches between jobseekers and a selected job.

**Important**: Do not modify the contents of the `json` files.

### **What to Build**

1. **Login page**  
   * Use the `jobseeker.json` file to simulate a login with a random password (such as OTP) using the email addresses for a specific jobseeker  
2. **A User Interface to Select a Job**  
   * Show a new page with jobseeker’s info (from `jobseeker.json` )   
   * Provide a way for users to choose a job from the available list (using `job.json`), show a simple listing of jobs (max 5-6 items each page).   
3. **Match & Display Job**  
   * Provide a way to filter the jobs at least for the match (use `match.json` as reference) and some others of your choice  
4. **Description of Your Approach**  
   * Use our site as reference of styles [https://www.home.stema.io/](https://www.home.stema.io/), [https://www.home.stema.io/about-stema](https://www.home.stema.io/about-stema), [https://www.home.stema.io/per-aziende](https://www.home.stema.io/per-aziende)  
   * Briefly explain how you **architected** the frontend and structured the backend logic.  
   * Talking about no-code/low-code tools, which one would you use for it? Can you list some pros/cons about using them instead of coded solutions?  
   * If you coded it (e.g., React, Vue, Angular, plain HTML/JS), outline how you structured components, state management, etc.  
5. **Steps to Run or Access the Application**  
   * Provide instructions on how to either:  
     * Run your code-based solution locally, or  
     * Access your no-code/low-code prototype (e.g., a share link or instructions on how to duplicate and run it).  
6. **Further Improvements**   
   * List any additional enhancements you would make if you had more time, particularly around:  
     * UX/UI improvements  
     * Accessibility considerations  
     * Scalability (e.g., if the dataset grows substantially)

## **Deliverables**

1. **Link to or zipped copy of your frontend application** (code or no-code/low-code project).  
2. if Github repo provided please use it privately and share to **https://github.com/stema-admin**  
3. **Short document** or `README.md` describing:  
   * The **frontend architecture**.  
   * **Setup/usage steps** (how to run or access).

**Good luck, and have fun building\!** Feel free to use any creative approach for your **frontend** while focusing on clear user journeys and maintainable design.
